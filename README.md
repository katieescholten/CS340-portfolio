### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

- By making the code readable on its own while also supplying comments and examples to show what my intent was when writing the code.

### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

- Instead of thinking about how the tables and data were organized, using MongoDB allowed me to think purely about how the data needs to be delivered to the end user.

### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

- Computer Scientists help companies deliver products in a cost effective and agile manner.  By developing code that is scalable and reusable computer scientist can help companies like Graziso Salvare deliver their product and use it effectively for what they need.
